        <p>Completed Bitmaker's Web Dev Bootcamp recently
          and graduated from a Data Analytics program with Honours
          last year. I am currently working on a Fitness website for
          a client. My next learning goals are to dig deeper into
          CSS, learn Redux for data flow, continue improving with React,
          and get some new projects rolling. I'm also great at teaching,
          relish passing knowledge on to others. I look forward to expanding
          my horizons as a developer.
